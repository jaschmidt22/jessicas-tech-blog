# Jessica's Tech Blog

## Description

I was given the task of building a CMS-style blog site similar to a Wordpress site. This blog site will be a place where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developers’ posts as well. In addition to creating new applications and debugging existing ones, developers also spent some of their time reading and writing about technical concepts and new technologies. I was required to build this site completely from scratch and deploy it to Heroku. During the making of this app, I learned how to follow the MVC paradigm in its architectural structure, using Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication.

## Usage

Once you navigate to the deployed site at you will see some existing blog posts on the homepage. Then click the 'sign-up' link and enter your username, e-mail and desired password. Your information will be saved in the database and your password will be securely hashed. Once you are logged in you are able to view the blog posts and add a comment if you like. If you click on the 'dashboard' link you will be presented with a form to enter your own post information. Once you have submitted your post, it will render on the dashboard page where you will also be able to edit and delete your posts.

## Credits

Throughout the making of this project, I frequently referenced my class repository ASU-VIRT-FSF-PT-10-2023-U-LOLC. I also referenced Google, W3Schools, MDN Webdocs, dev.mysql.com, sequelize.com, npmjs.com/express, npmjs.com/dotenv, handlebarsjs.com, getbootstrap.com and chatGPT. I also received tips during a tutoring session with Michell Brito and Wesley Clements.
